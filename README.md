## Projects

### 1. **ICD-10 Medical Coding Bot**
- **Tech Stack**: LLaMA, HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch
- **Summary**: Built an NLP pipeline to convert free-text doctor’s notes into ICD-10 codes using zero-shot classification.
- [GitHub Repo »](#)

### 2. [Chicago Crime Analysis](https://github.com/cwilli15/Chicago-Crime-Analysis)

An interactive data visualization and geospatial analysis of crime in Chicago using the official city dataset from 2001 to present. This project leverages Python libraries such as **GeoPandas**, **Folium**, and **Plotly** to map and interpret crime incidents across multiple years.

**Key Features:**
- 🗓️ Yearly crime comparisons (2021 & 2022)
- 🗺️ Heatmaps and marker clusters for interactive visualization
- 📌 Geo-mapping of major crime types like homicide, theft, and narcotics
- 📊 Plotly visualizations for crime categories
- 🧾 Cleaned and parsed raw public dataset from the City of Chicago

> 📍 *Built in Python 3.10 using Jupyter Notebook and geospatial libraries*
